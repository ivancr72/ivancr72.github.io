<p>The perfect IAL (totally not made in 5 minutes)</p>

<p>This language will bring peace and unity to all the world.</p>


<h2>Grammar</h2>

<p>It's English but the third person pronouns (he/she/they/it/all of the others) are replaced to they.</p>


<h2>Vocabulary</h2>

<p>It's English but the profession words ending in -(wo)man are all replaced with -person: </p>

<blockquote>mail(wo)man â†’ mailperson</blockquote>

<h2>Phonology</h2>

<p>It's English but /x/ becomes /k/.</p>

<h2>Orthography</h2>

<p>It's English but when punctuation is needed after quotes, it's written after the quotes:</p>

<blockquote><q>I am a fireman,</q> he said. <br> <q>I am a fireperson</q>, they said.</blockquote>
